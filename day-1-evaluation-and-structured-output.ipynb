    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course. In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This notebook is more code-heavy than the first Day 1 notebook ([Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/)). This notebook is not a prerequisite for days 2 and beyond, so feel free to skip over it, or come back later in the week. If you have not yet tried the [Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/) notebook, start there first as it introduces the fundamentals for interacting with LLMs.\n",

       "\n",
       "**1. Model Architecture:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a **sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.** This means it builds upon the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) but incorporates a MoE structure.\n",
       "*   MoE models use a **learned routing function** to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows the model to have a large total parameter count while only activating a portion of those parameters for any given input.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Training Data:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The model is trained on a **variety of multimodal and multilingual data.**\n",
       "*   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from many different domains, including **web documents, code, images, audio, and video content.**\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Training Infrastructure:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Gemini 1.5 Pro is trained on **multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators**, distributed across multiple datacenters.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Training Process:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Pre-training:** The model is initially pre-trained on the large, diverse dataset mentioned above.\n",
       "*   **Instruction Tuning:** After pre-training, Gemini 1.5 Pro is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n",
       "*   **Human Preference Tuning:** Further tuning is performed based on human preference data.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Aspects and Innovations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Long Context Understanding:** A series of significant architecture changes enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n",

       "    *   For Gemini, this means feeding the model the prepared data and asking it to predict the next word or token in a sequence.\n",

       "    *   You give the puppy specific instructions on how to behave. For example, you might tell it to \"sit\" or \"stay.\"\n",
       "    *   For Gemini, this means training the model on a smaller dataset of specific tasks, such as answering questions, summarizing text, or translating languages.\n",

    "# Instruction\n",
    "You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by two AI models. We will provide you with the user input and a pair of AI-generated responses (Response A and Response B). You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will first judge responses individually, following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Then you will give step-by-step explanations for your judgment, compare results to declare the winner based on the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## Metric Definition\n",
    "You will be assessing question answering quality, which measures the overall quality of the answer to the question in the user prompt. Pay special attention to length constraints, such as in X words or in Y sentences. The instruction for performing a question-answering task is provided in the user prompt. The response should not contain information that is not present in the context (if it is provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Criteria\n",
    "Instruction following: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the question answering task instructions, satisfying all of the instruction's requirements.\n",
    "Groundedness: The response contains information included only in the context if the context is present in the user prompt. The response does not reference any outside information.\n",
    "Completeness: The response completely answers the question with sufficient detail.\n",
    "Fluent: The response is well-organized and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rating Rubric\n",
    "\"A\": Response A answers the given question as per the criteria better than response B.\n",
    "\"SAME\": Response A and B answers the given question equally well as per the criteria.\n",
    "\"B\": Response B answers the given question as per the criteria better than response A.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Steps\n",
    "STEP 1: Analyze Response A based on the question answering quality criteria: Determine how well Response A fulfills the user requirements, is grounded in the context, is complete and fluent, and provides assessment according to the criterion.\n",
    "STEP 2: Analyze Response B based on the question answering quality criteria: Determine how well Response B fulfills the user requirements, is grounded in the context, is complete and fluent, and provides assessment according to the criterion.\n",
    "STEP 3: Compare the overall performance of Response A and Response B based on your analyses and assessment.\n",
    "STEP 4: Output your preference of \"A\", \"SAME\" or \"B\" to the pairwise_choice field according to the Rating Rubric.\n",
    "STEP 5: Output your assessment reasoning in the explanation field.\n",

    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learn more\n",
